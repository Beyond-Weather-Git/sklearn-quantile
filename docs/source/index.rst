*******************************************
Quantile machine learning models for python
*******************************************

This module provides quantile machine learning models for python, in a plug-and-play fashion in the sklearn environment.
This means that practically the only dependency is sklearn and all its functionality is applicable to the here provided
models without code changes.

Two tutorials explain the development of Random Forest Quantile regression. The same results and considerations are valid for K-nearest neighbours quantile regression and Extra Trees quantile regression.

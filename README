[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sklearn-quantile/badge/?version=latest)](https://sklearn-quantile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This module provides quantile machine learning models for python, in a plug-and-play fashion in the sklearn environment.
This means that practically the only dependency is sklearn and all its functionality is applicable to the here provided
models without code changes.

For guidance see (yet unhosted) docs. They include an example that for quantile regression forests in exactly the same
template as used for Gradient Boosting Quantile Regression in sklearn for comparability.

Implemented:
- Quantile Regression Forests (RandomForestQuantileRegressor, ExtraTreesQuantileRegressor, RandomForestMaximumRegressor
- Quantile K-nearest neighbors (KNeighborsQuantileRegressor)
